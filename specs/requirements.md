# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) application enables users to upload documents and automatically process them through a three-stage pipeline: OCR text extraction, document classification, and document summarization. The application provides a simple web interface for document upload and result viewing, with all processing results stored in a flexible database schema.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Document Upload
**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload documents through a web interface, so that I can process them through the IDP pipeline.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user accesses the web interface THE SYSTEM SHALL display a simple document upload form
2. WHEN a user selects a document file THE SYSTEM SHALL validate the file type and size
3. WHEN a user submits a valid document THE SYSTEM SHALL upload it to AWS S3 storage
4. WHEN a document is successfully uploaded THE SYSTEM SHALL trigger the IDP processing pipeline
5. WHEN a document upload fails THE SYSTEM SHALL display an error message to the user

### Requirement 2: OCR Text Extraction
**User Story:** As a system, I want to extract text content from uploaded documents, so that the text can be used for classification and summarization.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a document is uploaded to S3 THE SYSTEM SHALL trigger OCR processing
2. WHEN OCR processing starts THE SYSTEM SHALL extract text content from the document
3. WHEN OCR processing completes THE SYSTEM SHALL store the extracted text in JSON format
4. WHEN OCR processing fails THE SYSTEM SHALL log the error and update the processing status
5. WHEN OCR completes successfully THE SYSTEM SHALL trigger document classification

### Requirement 3: Document Classification
**User Story:** As a system, I want to classify documents based on their content, so that users can understand the document type.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN OCR processing completes THE SYSTEM SHALL start document classification
2. WHEN classification starts THE SYSTEM SHALL analyze the extracted text content
3. WHEN classification completes THE SYSTEM SHALL determine the document category
4. WHEN classification results are ready THE SYSTEM SHALL store them in the database
5. WHEN classification completes successfully THE SYSTEM SHALL trigger document summarization

### Requirement 4: Document Summarization
**User Story:** As a system, I want to generate summaries of document content, so that users can quickly understand key information.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN document classification completes THE SYSTEM SHALL start summarization
2. WHEN summarization starts THE SYSTEM SHALL generate a concise summary of the document
3. WHEN summarization completes THE SYSTEM SHALL store the summary in the database
4. WHEN summarization results are ready THE SYSTEM SHALL update the processing status to complete
5. WHEN all processing completes THE SYSTEM SHALL notify the user interface

### Requirement 5: Results Display
**User Story:** As a user, I want to view the processing results in the web interface, so that I can see the extracted text, classification, and summary.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN processing is complete THE SYSTEM SHALL display all results in the user interface
2. WHEN a user views results THE SYSTEM SHALL show the original document name and upload time
3. WHEN displaying results THE SYSTEM SHALL show extracted text, classification, and summary
4. WHEN processing is in progress THE SYSTEM SHALL show the current processing status
5. WHEN processing fails THE SYSTEM SHALL display error information to the user

### Requirement 6: Data Storage
**User Story:** As a system, I want to store all processing results in a flexible database, so that data can be retrieved and displayed efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN any processing step completes THE SYSTEM SHALL store results in DynamoDB
2. WHEN storing data THE SYSTEM SHALL use a flexible schema to accommodate different result types
3. WHEN retrieving data THE SYSTEM SHALL efficiently query results by document ID
4. WHEN data is updated THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain consistency across all processing stages
5. WHEN querying fails THE SYSTEM SHALL handle errors gracefully and log appropriate messages
